Types of Requirement
- User Requirements 
	- Functional Requirement - Describes the system services, behaviours and functions
	- Non-functional Requirement - Describe how a system perform its said function
		- Complete Requirement - all necessary aspects are covered
		- Consistent Requirement (does not contradict) - no conflict or contradiction, all non functional requirements align with functional requirements
- System Requirement

## Requirement Engineering Process
It is the process of establishing the services that the customer requires from the system and the constraints under which it opera
Process of gathering the requirements from user -> **Requirement Engineering Process**

Different Stages in Requirement Engineering Process
1. Feasibility Analysis
2. Requirement Elicitation and Analysis
3. Requirement Specification
4. System Model
5. User & System Requirements
6. Requirement Validation
7. Software Requirement Specification

Below are the five different steps:
1. Feasibility Analysis 
	1. Does the system align with the objectives of the organisation?
	2. Can the system be implemented with the given time and resources?
	3. Can the system be implemented with given technologies?
2. Requirement Elicitation and Analysis
3. Requirement Specification
4. Requirement Validation
5. Requirement Management

### Requirement Elicitation and Analysis
Process of gathering intelligent information through a series of 4 activities namely
1. Requirement Discovery
2. Requirement Classification and Organisation
3. Requirement Prioritisation and Negotiation
4. Requirement Specification

**Requirement Discovery** is the process of gathering intelligent information about the existing system and the proposed system and finally distilling a set of user and system requirements. It is done using four steps:
- Viewpoints
- Open / Closed Interviews
- Scenarios
- Ethnography

**Requirement Classification and Organisation** is a process of iterating over unstructured requirements and grouping them into coherent clusters

**Requirement Prioritisation and Negotiation** is a process of assigning a priority, identifying and resolving conflicts through in requirements through negotiation

**Requirement Document** is a structured representation of all the final and conflict free requirements

### Requirement Validation
Process of validating structured list of requirements from REA for a better developmental phase

There are five checks performed in Requirement Validation. They are:
1. Validation Check - ?
2. Consistency Check - ensure no conflicting or contradictory requirements
3. Completeness Check - ensure that all requirements define a system and its features as intended by the user
4. Realism Check - ensure that the given list of constraints can be implemented using current technologies, budget and time constraints
5. Verifiability - document the final list of requirements and get approval from both user and contractor to avoid conflicts

There are three techniques used to validate a set of requirements. They are:
1. Requirement Review - analysed by a team of reviewers for errors and inconsistencies
2. Prototyping - an executable model is shown to end users and customers
3. Test-case Generation 

### Requirements Management
process of understanding and controlling changes to the system requirements 
keeping track of individual requirements and linking dependent requirements to analyse the impact to the system upon requirement change

**Requirement Management Process (RMP):**
1. Requirement Identification - uniquely identify each process, can be cross references later
2. Change Management Process - assessing the impact and cost of changes
3. Traceability Policies - define relationship between each requirement
4. Tool Support - like Spreadsheets and Simple Databases
