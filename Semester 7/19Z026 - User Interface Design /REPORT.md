THE HUMAN 
Visual Overload:
The homepage has numerous sliders, announcements, and menus that overwhelm users.
Visual clutter makes it harder to focus and perceive useful information
Ineffective Information Hierarchy:
Important elements (like flight info, alerts) are not clearly distinguished from lesser-used content.
The human short-term memory (7 ± 2 items) is overloaded with too many choices.
Limited Accessibility:
No screen reader indicators or high-contrast toggle.
No support for color-blind users 
Poor Mobile Responsiveness:
Touch targets are small; they don't account for motor limitations or touch interaction feedback.
Sliders are hard to swipe precisely (this affects users with lower dexterity or using only one hand.)
Cognitive Load:
Multiple menus with nested items increase the mental processing burden.
The user is not guided to formulate a clear intention or goal.

THE COMPUTER 
Slow Load Times & Large Assets:
The homepage loads a large number of images, scripts, and stylesheets.
Affects users on low-speed connections or older devices, ignoring computing diversity.
Inconsistent Performance Across Browsers:
Certain elements (like sliders or embedded maps) do not render the same on Chrome and Safari.
Inadequate Feedback Systems:
Clicking on certain links (e.g., “Login”) results in no visual loading indicator or status updates.
Delays in feedback disrupt the sense of interactivity and user control.
Over-reliance on Sliders/Carousels:
These often fail accessibility tests and don’t retain user attention effectively, especially for older users or those with disabilities.

THE INTERACTION 	
1. Poor Use of Interaction Paradigms:
Doesn't leverage Direct Manipulation principles (e.g., click-to-reveal, drag-drop).
Lacks WYSIWYG (What You See Is What You Get) behavior, which reduces user trust.
2. Overuse of Menus:
Dropdowns and flyouts lack visual cues or grouping based on frequency or importance, violating ergonomics.
Example: "Airport Operations" and "Air Navigation Services" both have extensive submenus that aren't intuitively grouped.
3. Lack of Context Awareness:
The system does not adapt based on user geography, flight interest, or previous visits.
4. Not Designed for Flow:
The user journey (from checking flights to booking parking or lounges) is not smooth. 
This violates the idea of maintaining a flow state or minimizing execution effort.
THE PARADIGM
1. Command Line Interface (CLI) Paradigm:
The AAI website is GUI-based and offers no CLI or keyboard shortcut interface.
For frequent users (e.g., airport staff, operators), a shortcut-based interface or dashboard could improve speed.[ Adding keyboard navigation (e.g., Tab key for accessibility)might enhance control. ]
2. WIMP Paradigm (Windows, Icons, Menus, Pointer)
Menus are cluttered and over-nested (e.g., "Airport Operations" has 5–6 sub-levels), violating good WIMP design.
Icons are inconsistent or missing in many sections. Some clickable items don't appear interactive.
3. Direct Manipulation Paradigm
Most elements are not interactively responsive (e.g., clicking airport maps or visuals doesn’t zoom, show info, etc.).
No drag-and-drop or real-time interaction with airport services.
4. Menu Selection Paradigm
Too many menu items with deep (more choices = slower decisions).
No personalization: All users see the same menus, regardless of context or role (passenger vs operator).
5. Form Fill-In Paradigm
Many forms are long (e.g., grievance redressal, tenders) and not well chunked.
No inline validation — errors are shown only after submission.
6. Agent-Based Paradigm
No chatbot or vocal assistance.
Missed opportunity for multilingual voice assistance, especially for passengers from rural areas or non-English speakers.
7. Multimodal Paradigm
Website is mostly visual/textual — no support for alternate modalities like voice, haptics, or gestures.
No support for screen readers, captions, or language toggling.
