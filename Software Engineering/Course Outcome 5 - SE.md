## Cost of Quality
All cost incurred while trying to maximise product quality 
Four different types of costs:
- Prevention Cost
- Appraisal Cost
- Failure Cost
- External Failure Cost

Prevention Cost
- Quality Planning, Formal Technical Reviews
- determined during the start of a product
- saves on labor and manufacture cost

Appraisal Cost
- cost for work towards identifying defective items or assessing quality of a product
- inprocess or interprocess inspection, equipment calibration etc

Failure Cost
- incurred after detecting a defect in a product just before shipping
- Rework, Repair Failure Mode Analysis

External Failure Cost
- incurred after detecting a defect in a product after shipping it to customer
- customer support, complaint resolution, Product Return / Replacement

## Software Quality Assurance

Responsible for ensuring that software products meet desired level of quality by planning, reviewing, testing, process improvement, metrics and collaboration


### Formal Technical Review

This is an activity under Software Quality Assurance.

Formal Technical Reviews are used to:
- Uncover errors in logic 
- verify if software meets requirements 
- verify if software has been developed according to the pre defined standards
- check if the product has been developed in a uniform manner
- check if the product is easy to manage

Three to Five people are usually involved in FTRs. Advance Preparation required (< 2 hours)
Duration of FTR should be short (<2 hours)

One person at the FTR meeting should record all the issues raised in the meeting and summarize meeting at the end. Finally prepare an FTR summary too

Review Guidelines: 
1. Review product not producer
2. set agenda and stick to agenda
3. limit debate or rebuttal 
4. identify problem spaces but do not solve them 
5. take notes
6. limit participation, insist advance preparation
7. checklist for products to be reviewed
8. allocate time for FTR
9. conduct meaningful training
