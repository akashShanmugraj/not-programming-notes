System users often judge a system by its interface, rather than by its functionality. A poorly designed interface can cause a user to make catastrophic errors and is often why software systems are never used. Interface design focuses on three areas:

1. interface between software components
2. interface between software component and other entities
3. interface between software component and human

#### Golden Rules

1. Placing user in control
	- reduce demand on short term memory
	- define shortcuts that are intuitive for the user
	- visual layout based on real world metaphor 
2. Reducing the user's memory load 
	- allow the user to put current task into a meaningful context
3. Make the interface consistent
	- maintain consistency across a family of applications
	- do not change the past expectation unless its absolutely needed

The below design principles below will ensure a successful user experience

| Principle            | Description                                           |
| -------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| **User familiarity** | Use language and concepts that users already know.    |
| **Consistency**      | Make similar actions work in the same way every time. |
| **Minimal surprise** | Ensure the system behaves as users expect.            |
| **Recoverability**   | Provide ways for users to fix mistakes easily.        |
| **User guidance**    | Offer clear feedback and helpful tips when needed.    |
| **User diversity**   | Cater to the needs of different types of users.       |
