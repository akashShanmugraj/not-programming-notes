## Prototype Testing, evaluation and improvements
- Feedback Capture
	- Feedback Grid
	- I like, I wish, What if
	- Stories Feedback
- User testing types and steps
- User experience vs User Interface
- Types of prototypes


Best Practices
1. Inperson / Remote
2. identify correct age group / demography
3. ask core and open questions
4. no bias while presenting ideas, never sell ideas
5. let participants contribute ideas

#### Feedback Capture Grid
- organise feedback in a structured way
- has four quadrants, Likes, Criticisms, Questions, Ideas
- get feedback for all the quadrants 

#### I like, I wish, What if - feedback grid
- Three Questions:
	- I like - positive feedback
	- I wish - negative constructive criticism
	- What if - new suggestions by users, new ideas for DT team to explore
- Gather feedback, discuss with DT team
- Brainstorm and integrate feedback into prototype

#### Sharing Inspiring Stories
- after testing rounds get together and share inspiring stories
- find what resonates with yourself and your teammates and start working on that

### User Testing
- Moderated vs Unmoderated
- In-person vs remote
- Types:
	1. Concept Testing
	2. A/B Testing
	3. Usability Testing
	4. First Click Testing
	5. Tree Testing

Concept Testing
- create low fidelity prototypes to gauge user's initial reaction and feelings about the concept

A/B Testing
- Comparing two different versions of a design (low/high fidelity) to determine which performs better

Usability Testing
- focus on how easy it is for users to interact with a prototype or design
- more frequent usability tests - more information for designers identify pattern and gather feedback

First Click Testing
- examines what the user does when they encounter an interface
- helps determine the importance, placement of buttons, etc

Tree Testing
- evaluates how easily users can find information within a site's structure by having them navigate a simplified text based version of the site's hierarchy


In the context of design thinking, user interface (UI) and user experience (UX) are closely related but distinct concepts. Here’s a breakdown of their differences:

### Difference between User Interface (UI) and User Experience (UX)

**User Interface (UI)**
- UI refers to the visual elements and interactive components through which users interact with a product or service
- It's objective is to create an attractive, intuitive, and responsive interface that facilitates user interaction
- It focuses on look and feel, layout, and interactive features of a digital product

**User Experience (UX)**
- UX refers to the overall experience a user has when interacting with a product or service
- It's objective is to create a seamless, efficient, and satisfying experience for the user that meets their needs and expectations
- It focuses on usability, accessibility, performance, and emotional satisfaction

UI focuses on the product’s interface and its aesthetics and interactivity
UX is concerned with the overall experience and satisfaction of the user
