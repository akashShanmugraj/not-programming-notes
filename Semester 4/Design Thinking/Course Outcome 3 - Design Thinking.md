Prototypes are tangible products used in the final testing phase which helps us learn how users feel, interact and think about the product

They are early, scaled down and inexpensive version of the product used to reveal any problems with current design and to observe, record and judge user performance levels

### Need for prototype:
1. To obtain early feedback
2. Save time and cost
3. Communicate design ideas to engineering teams 
4. Evaluate technical feasibility
5. Check usability
6. Building Market Communication

Prototyping is essential during and after ideation to break down complex problems, test ideas, identify and correct issues, make informed design decisions and ensure the product works as intended before launch

### Proof of Concept (PoC) vs Prototype vs Minimum Viable Product (MVP)

| **Goal**               | Confirm technical Feasibility       | Test a product design                          | Evaluate market viability      |
| **Time to Completion** | Several Days/Weeks                  | Several Weeks                                  | Several Months                 |
| **Target Audience**    | Internal Stakeholders and Investors | Internal Stakeholders, Investors and End Users | A wide range of users          |
| **Form**               | Diagrams, Presentations             | Clickable Demo                                 | Working tool with key features |
| **Stage**              | Idea Validation                     | Design and Development                         | Prelaunch                      |
| **User Interaction**   | Minimum                             | High                                           | Maximum                        |

## Guidelines in Prototyping
1. Just start building
	1. Clarify the uncertainties by building the product
	2. Prototypes makes abstract ideas more concrete
2. Don't spend too much time 
	1. The longer you spend time on a prototype the more emotionally attached, thereby hampering your ability to objectively judge its merits and demerits
3. Remember what you are testing for
	1. Do not lose sight of the central testing issue and the other lessons you can learn from it
4. Build with user in mind
	1. Test the prototype against user's behaviours and needs
	2. Learn from the gaps in expectations and realities to improve your ideas

Here are some 10 different types of prototypes ([source](https://www.indeed.com/career-advice/career-development/types-of-prototyping))
1. Sketches and Diagrams - Basic paper drawings to conceptualize a new product idea
2. 3D Printing or Rapid Model - Quick 3D-printed models to test designs before production
3. Physical Model - Scaled physical prototypes made from basic materials
4. Wireframe - Digital diagrams or layouts for websites, software, and digital tools
5. Role-play through virtual or augmented reality  - Visualizing a design through VR or AR
6. Feasibility - Prototypes to test specific features added later in the design process
7. Working Model - Functional prototypes to test how a product actually operates
8. Video Prototype - Animated videos or simulations to present a product concept
9. Horizontal Prototype - Prototypes focused on the user interface and interaction
10. Vertical Prototype - Prototypes to test back-end functions and database design


## Prototypes
### Low Fidelity Prototype
- Basic models which are incomplete with less features 
- Constructed from materials different from final product 
- cheaply and easily made 
- used in early stages of design thinking
- Story Boarding, Sketching, Card Sorting, Wizard of Oz
#### Advantages
- Quick and Inexpensive
- Possible to make instant changes
- Disposable
- Can get overall view of the design

#### Disadvantages
- Lack realism
- Cannot test user experience on Low-Fi prototypes
- Remove control from user


### High Fidelity Prototype
- Looks closer to the final product
- Developed using tools like Sketch, Blender, etc
- Used in later stages of design thinking

#### Advantages
- Allows users to engage with the prototype
- Validity and Applicability can also be tested

#### Disadvantages
- Changes are not easy to make
- Users may comment on superficial characteristics rather than the actual functionality of the product
- Can give false information of how good the product can be or how worse the product can be

## Tasks in Prototyping

Below are the different tasks in prototyping:
1. Create a persona - Identify the target users 
2. Conduct Market Research
3. Define design requirements
4. Ideate multiple concepts
5. Conduct Feasibility Analysis

#### Creating an Appearance Model
Appearance Model is the representation of the product's visual design
1. Begin by sketching and redesign until you feel confident
2. Test your final design from the user and gather feedback
3. Create a virtual 3D model / engineered physical model and reiterate without wasting any time or money
4. Work with a team to focus on functionality, appearance and feasibility
5. Finalise the design and proceed to create final physical model

#### Alpha and Beta Prototype
- In alpha phase design is refined based on PoC evaluation
- Alpha prototype is proven concept that is made into a product while being aesthetic and functional (less)
- Non functional features security, reliability, compliance are incorporated during the beta phase 

#### Pilot Production / Minimum Viable Product
- Test and refine (several iterations)
- make changes based on feedback

### Prototyping and Testing Flow

Flow 1: 
1. Appearance Model (PoC)
2. Alpha and Beta Prototype
3. Test and User Feedback
4. Pilot Production

Flow 2: 
1. Create a visual prototype
2. Rapid Prototyping 
3. Test and Validate
4. Seek Feedback and Iterate
5. Build final (production ready) prototype
6. Documentation and Communication
