### Interview Questions
- How does your typical day look like?
- How often do you use the overhead bridge a day?
- What specific problems do you face upon the removal of the bridge?
- What solutions do you think will be suitable as a replacement ?
- Crossing during times of rush, for example an exam day?
- What is your opinion on the bridge being removed?

### Empathy Map

#### Introduction
Empathy mapping allows us to visualize user thoughts, feelings, and pain points, helping us deeply understand their needs. By walking in the user's shoes, we can design solutions that resonate with their experiences and improve their lives.

#### User Insights from Interviews
1. **Lakshmi Priya:**
   - Uses the bridge at least once a day; sometimes three times.
   - Concerns about increased congestion and delays without the bridge.
   - Suggests alternatives like constructing another bridge or installing traffic signals.

2. **Preethi Kamal:**
   - Uses the bridge at least four times daily.
   - Views the bridge removal as a loss of a landmark, leading to potential traffic issues.
   - Proposes solutions like building a subway or using pelican signals.

#### Empathy Map Summary
- **Says:** Both personas use the bridge multiple times daily and see its removal as a significant inconvenience.
- **Thinks:** Removal will lead to increased congestion and delays.
- **Does:** Depend on the bridge for safe and efficient crossing.
- **Feels:** Concerned about safety, increased traffic, and disruptions to their routine.


### Ideation

#### Possible Solutions
- Construction of a Subway

- Construction of another overhead bridge

- Pelican Signal

- Installing traffic signals and cops to ease the crossing 

#### Most feasible solution is Construction of Another Overhead Bridge



### Prototypes

#### Low-fidelity Prototype

![Lego bridge](https://github.com/akashShanmugraj/programming-notes/assets/65720968/cbdc576d-f511-4b7c-8d1f-c98457a0a255)

Low fidelity prototype made using LEGO bricks, because it is easy to dismantle and build any structure.

#### High-fidelity Prototype
High fidelity prototype version1 was made using Ice cream sticks because it gave structural integrity to the design than any other material.It was also easily available and quite affordable.

### Testing and Feedback

#### Importance of Testing
Testing is crucial for validating the design, ensuring user satisfaction, and identifying areas for improvement. Feedback loops are vital for continuous refinement and optimization.

#### Conceptual Testing
- **Objectives:** Validate feasibility and effectiveness before detailed designs.
- **Process:**
  - Define objectives and select participants resembling end users.
  - Develop concept presentations for visual and practical feedback.
  - Create testing materials (surveys, feedback forms).
  - Gather and analyze feedback to refine the design.

### Interview Questions and Responses

1. **How does your typical day look like?**
   - Lakshmi Priya: Travels 30 km by bus, uses the bridge to cross from the bus stop to college, attends lectures, commutes back home.
   - Preethi Kamal: Uses the bridge four times daily for commuting between the hostel and college.

2. **How often do you use the overhead bridge a day?**
   - Lakshmi Priya: At least once, sometimes up to three times.
   - Preethi Kamal: At least four times daily.

3. **What specific problems do you face upon the removal of the bridge?**
   - Both personas express concerns about increased traffic congestion, delays, and safety issues.

4. **What solutions do you think will be suitable as a replacement?**
   - Lakshmi Priya: Suggests constructing another bridge or installing traffic signals.
   - Preethi Kamal: Proposes building a subway or using pelican signals.

5. **Crossing during times of rush, for example, an exam day?**
   - Both: Increased crowd leads to congestion and potential safety hazards.

6. **What is your opinion on the bridge being removed?**
   - Both view it as a significant inconvenience, causing delays and potential safety issues.

### Feedback Analysis

#### Insights from Feedback
- **What Worked:**
  - Triangular supports added great stability to the bridge.
  - Lightweight design improved performance.
  - Aesthetic and cool design.
  - Symmetrical design maintained balance and stability under loads.

- **What Did Not Work:**
  - Some ice cream sticks started to bend.
  - Connection points between different sections were weak.
  - Misalignment of sticks caused uneven load distribution.
  - Adhesive bonds weakened over time, leading to joint failures under prolonged stress.

- **New Ideas:**
  - Use a template to ensure sticks are cut to the exact same length.
  - Integrate metal clips at joints to improve overall stability.
  - Explore composite materials and different adhesives under various conditions.

- **Further Research:**
  - Investigate the impact of varying stick thickness on bridge performance.
  - Optimize stick arrangements for maximum load distribution.
  - Analyze environmental factors affecting adhesive performance.

### Key Takeaways
- **Empathy and User-Centric Design:** Essential for creating solutions that resonate with user needs and preferences.
- **Iterative Prototyping:** Allows for gradual improvement and ensures the final product is of the highest quality.
- **Continuous Improvement:** Feedback loops are critical for refining designs and achieving optimal user satisfaction.
