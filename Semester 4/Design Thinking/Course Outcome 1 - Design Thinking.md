## The Good Kitchen Problem

**1. What Is? (Empathize & Define)**

- **Focus:** Understanding the current situation and user needs.
- **Activities:** User research through observation, interviews, and journey mapping. Analyzing existing data on service delivery and user interaction.
- **Goal:** Develop a deep understanding of the problem space, including the challenges faced by elderly users and the limitations of the existing meal service.

- Hatch and Bloom observed elderly people in their homes during meal delivery and preparation.
- They interviewed users and service providers to understand pain points like bland food, difficulty opening packages, and lack of social interaction.

**2. What If? (Ideate)**

- **Focus:** Generating creative solutions based on user needs and identified problems.
- **Activities:** Brainstorming sessions, rapid prototyping, and workshops with diverse stakeholders (seniors, designers, chefs).
- **Goal:** Explore a wide range of possibilities and identify potential solutions that could address user needs and improve the service.

- The team brainstormed ways to personalize menus, improve packaging, and enhance the meal experience.
- They created low-fidelity prototypes for meal kit designs and experimented with different menu options.

**3. What Wows? (Prototype & Test)**

- **Focus:** Refining and testing potential solutions with real users.
- **Activities:** Building more detailed prototypes, usability testing with target users, and gathering feedback through surveys and interviews.
- **Goal:** Evaluate the effectiveness of proposed solutions and identify what resonates best with users.

- Hatch and Bloom built prototypes of improved meal kits with easy-open packaging and personalized menus.
- They tested these prototypes with senior users and collected feedback on usability, taste, and overall experience.

**4. What Works? (Iterate & Implement)**

- **Focus:** Finalizing the best solution based on user feedback and testing results.
- **Activities:** Iterating on the design based on feedback, creating a final implementation plan, and pilot testing before wider rollout.
- **Goal:** Implement the most effective solution with real-world users and ensure it delivers the desired impact.

- Based on user feedback, the team refined the meal kit design, introduced a two-course guest menu, and improved menu descriptions.
- They piloted the revamped service with a limited group before implementing it across the entire program.


## Visualisation Tools
1. Story Telling
2. Journey Mapping
3. Value Chain Analysis
4. Mind Mapping
5. Brainstorming
6. Rapid Concept Development
7. Assumption Testing
8. Prototyping
9. Customer Co Creation
10. Learning Launch

### Mind Map
- Captures a designer's viewpoint
- selecting one idea from a pool of ideas
- done during the ideation phase
- Themes -> Topics -> Subtopics -> Ideas

### Customer Journey Map
- Visually outlines a customer's experience with a product / service
- Understanding customer thoughts, feelings, actions
- Identifying touch points
- Uncovering pain points

By identifying touchpoints, you understand how users interact with your product or service.

- A user visiting a company's website.
- Interacting with customer service via phone or chat.
- Visiting a physical store location.

By identifying pain points, you understand where the user experience needs improvement.

- A confusing layout or navigation on a website.
- A slow-loading app that crashes frequently.
- Long wait times and unhelpful customer service representatives.
